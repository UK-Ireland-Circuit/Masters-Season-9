Teams must have all 5 players present on the server for a match to take place. Teams are not allowed to start with 4v5, 3v5 etc

**Agent skins are forbidden**, if an opposing team is using them they must be reported **before the match**, no action will be taken after the match has ended.

movement automations via script or hardware, this includes but not limited to:

- null bind scripts in config files
- Snap Tap / SOCD, Rappy Snappy or other hardware equivalent

Intentionally impacting the flow of the game, such as players leaving and re-joining the server to influence player cash, saving in unintended locations, planting the bomb in a position where it is impossible for a counter terrorist to defuse.

If there is any advantage a team would like clarified please reach out to the admin team.

### 4.2.10 Round Not Live / “NL”

If a player or team is having technical issues at the start of a round they can call “Not Live” or “NL” via the in-game all chat, initiate a Technical Pause and call an Admin. This informs the opposition team that a player is having an issue and the current round is invalid.

- Once the round has ended and the Technical Pause has started the affected player / team must follow [4.2.10 Technical Issues](https://www.notion.so/Rulebook-2648b29a95c48185babed146c5e3ea0f?pvs=21)
- If the opposition team believes the “Not Live” has been called outside the scope of [4.2.11 Match Interruptions](https://www.notion.so/Rulebook-2648b29a95c48185babed146c5e3ea0f?pvs=21) they can continue to play the round as normal and contest the “Not Live” with an Admin during the Tech Pause
- The Admin will have the final say if the round will be restored for the team affected by the issue or awarded to the team contesting the “Not Live”

### 4.2.11 Technical Issues

In the case of an Online Match:

Teams are limited to five (5) minutes of technical pauses per map. After this time has run out a Team may use a tactical timeout to allow more time to resolve issues(s).

Teams are allowed to donate a portion of their technical time to their opponent during the match.

If an issue cannot be resolved within the allotted five (5) minutes, Team(s) can request additional time from an Admin via Discord. This additional time will be given at the discretion of the Admin dealing with the situation.

If, after the additional time the technical issue can not be rectified, the affected team will forfeit the map / match. In the event of a BO3 the affected team will have an additional fifteen (15) minutes to rectify the issue or use a listed substitute.

Players must continue to play out any ongoing round until the pause has come into effect to allow Admins to make a decision according to the Rulebook.

The misuse of a Technical Pause for a non-technical issue will result in the game being un-paused.

### 4.2.12 **Match Interruptions**

Any match interruption should be immediately reported to UKIC Admins by the Team and any Participant also affected.

In the case of a technical issue the round will be restarted unless the round has reached the point of incidents.

The point of incident is to be deﬁned exclusively by the UKIC Admin, generally this will include either team receiving significant damage, a clear information advantage, or the round has less than one (1) minute remaining.
